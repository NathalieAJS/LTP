Grass grows greener in the graveyard
Due to his mental breakdown, the house burned down
Don't you like it when hurricanes pass by?
He pleaded for forgiveness but her heart was cold iron
I have a temporary negative cash flow
Emma never has anything interesting to say
Those glasses are pretty ugly
The police station got robbed
The beef hamburgers are not so tasty
The flowers inside the vase were begging for water
You did not possible think that I would say yes, right?
Yuk, that fish smells so bad!
