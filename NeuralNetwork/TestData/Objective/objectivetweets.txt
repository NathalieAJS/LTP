The lion licked his lips
It was raining during the training
Weather forecast for tonight: dark
The computer we have is an old dinosaur
Bob lived in an economically depressed neighborhood
Matthew knows everything about computers
My boss went on a working vacation
The teacher failed his own test
Mary lives up north of us
The books flew off the shelves
Is the pope catholic?
The tiger let out a loud roar
