Americans are always attractive
When the phone is ringing, Anne likes to be singing
I really hate that I earn so much money
Her eyes were fireflies
There weren't any intelligent ventilation points in the sweater, not even after wearing it for years!
These shoes are the best thing ever
I finally found the impossible solution to that question
My neighbors wanted a divorce, but during the proceedings they loved eachother and remarried
They offered free gifts to everyone
I really like the Rembrandt over there
Where have you been all my life??
Chris told us a funny story while staring at the warm and crackling fire
